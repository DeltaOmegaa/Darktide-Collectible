## How to contribute
There are two ways to contribute to this repository. Either you can create a pull request with the added locations, or send me a message with the location (might take a while until I add them)

## How to use
The index file is the landing page which links to the different Markdown files in the location folders. Every Mission folder got a image folder where the images are stored and a ``Grimoires.md`` and ``Scripters.md`` file. Those will be rendered through the webserver and displayed on the page
